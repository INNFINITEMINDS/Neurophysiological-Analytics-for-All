##### *Please see the above report for information on the notebooks and data. A temporary executable environment with working Jupyter notebooks can be initiated by clicking the Binder link below -- an example of REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH, which can regenerate The analysis from raw data to computational analysis to publication-quality graphics! Feel free to experiment with the code in this temporary environment. If you have comments, please post an issue. Thank you.**

###### This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) Program (award# U18EB021772) and a grant to the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (award# P30CA047904, Cancer Center Support Grant).

##### Usage Notes:
* Running the Jupyter notebooks will produce output files, including images, analyzed data, and shareable HTML copies of the notebooks, which are accessible by going to "Open ..." on the Jupyter File menu.
* The spike sorting notebook needs to be run before the spike train notebook, which depends on a spike timestamp output file.
* For offline file usage, Python and R dependencies are listed in the README documents in the Supplement folders.
